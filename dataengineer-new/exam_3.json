There must be some telecoms issue with it, which we can assume is unresolvable e.g. long distance remote locations and sometimes water ingress, and the telco can't justify sorting it yet, or is slow to, or something.

Listings let you share data without replicating the shared data. You can build a catalog of analytics-ready data sources with granular permissions that let you deliver data to the right audiences.\n\n As an Analytics Hub subscriber, you can discover the data that you are looking for, combine shared data with your existing data, and leverage the built-in features of BigQuery. When you subscribe to a listing, a linked dataset is created in your project.\n\n As an Analytics Hub viewer, you can browse through the datasets that you have access to in Analytics Hub and request the publisher to access the shared data.\n\n As an Analytics Hub administrator, you can create data exchanges that enable data sharing, and then give permissions to data publishers and subscribers to access these data exchanges.\nhttps://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/analytics-hub-introduction","timestamp":"1693666800.0","comment_id":"657534"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/view/79459-exam-professional-data-engineer-topic-1-question-115/","unix_timestamp":1662130800,"choices":{"D":"Create a Dataflow job that reads the data in frequent time intervals, and writes it to the relevant BigQuery dataset or Cloud Storage bucket for third-party companies to use.","C":"Create a separate dataset in BigQuery that contains the relevant data to share, and provide third-party companies with access to the new dataset.","A":"Use Analytics Hub to control data access, and provide third party companies with access to the dataset.","B":"Use Cloud Scheduler to export the data on a regular basis to Cloud Storage, and provide third-party companies with access to the bucket."},"question_images":[],"question_id":19,"timestamp":"2022-09-02 17:00:00","answer_description":"","answer":"A","answer_ET":"A","topic":"1","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_text":"You use a dataset in BigQuery for analysis.
