The cluster is designed to accommodate peak usage on the system; however, many jobs are batch in nature, and usage of the cluster fluctuates quite dramatically. Your company is eager to move to the cloud to reduce the overhead associated with on-premises infrastructure and maintenance and to benefit from the cost savings. They are also hoping to modernize their existing infrastructure to use more serverless offerings in order to take advantage of the cloud. Because of the timing of their contract renewal with the colocation facility, they have only 2 months for their initial migration.
