For a cost-effective solution, GPU acceleration provides the best performance per dollar.\n\nSince the model must run partially on CPUs, a VM instance with GPUs added will allow TensorFlow to offload appropriate operations to the GPUs while keeping CPU-specific operations on the CPU.

BigQuery can act as a serving layer for the models.\n• Options A, C, and D either don't provide real-time processing (A and C) or don't easily integrate with BigQuery for analysis and serving (D).","comments":[{"content":"So B is the best architecture here to meet the needs of near real-time cleansing, identification of longtail/outlier data points, and integration with BigQuery for serving AI models.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"MaxNRG","comment_id":"1115703","timestamp":"1720339560.0"}],"timestamp":"1720339560.0","comment_id":"1115702","poster":"MaxNRG","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"raaad","content":"Selected Answer: B\n- Dataflow is a fully managed service for stream and batch data processing and is well-suited for real-time data processing tasks like identifying longtail and outlier data points.\n- Using BigQuery as a sink allows to efficiently store the cleansed and processed data for further analysis and serving it to AI models.","timestamp":"1719938220.0","comment_id":"1112142"},{"comment_id":"1109522","content":"Selected Answer: B\nReal-time Data Processing: Dataflow excels at handling large-scale, streaming data with low latency, enabling near-real-time cleansing.\nScalability: Easily scales to handle growing data volumes and processing needs.\nProgrammatic Data Cleaning: Allows you to write custom logic in Apache Beam for identifying longtail and outlier data points accurately and efficiently.\nIntegration with BigQuery: Seamless integration with BigQuery enables you to store cleansed data for AI model training and historical analytics.\nCost-Effective: Dataflow's pay-as-you-go model optimizes costs for real-time data processing.","timestamp":"1719728640.0","poster":"e70ea9e","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_id":120,"exam_id":10,"choices":{"A":"Use Cloud Storage as a data warehouse, shell scripts for processing, and BigQuery to create views for desired datasets.","C":"Use BigQuery to ingest, prepare, and then analyze the data, and then run queries to create views.","D":"Use Cloud Composer to identify longtail and outlier data points, and then output a usable dataset to BigQuery.","B":"Use Dataflow to identify longtail and outlier data points programmatically, with BigQuery as a sink."},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/view/129853-exam-professional-data-engineer-topic-1-question-206/","question_images":[]}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":true,"numberOfQuestions":319,"lastUpdated":"15 Feb 2025","provider":"Google","isBeta":false,"name":"Professional Data Engineer","id":10,"isImplemented":true},"currentPage":24},"__N_SSP":true}
