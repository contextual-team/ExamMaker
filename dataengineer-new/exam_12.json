Using sliding windows every 5 minutes allows you to compute moving averages efficiently.\n\nSliding Time Window: The sliding time window of 1 hour every 5 minutes enables you to calculate the moving average over the specified time frame.\n\nComputing Averages: You can efficiently compute the average when each sliding window closes. This approach ensures that you have real-time visibility into the message rate and can detect deviations from the expected rate.\n\nAlerting: When the calculated average drops below 4000 messages per second, you can trigger an alert from within the Dataflow pipeline, sending it to your desired alerting mechanism, such as Cloud Monitoring, Pub/Sub, or another notification service.\n\nScalability: Dataflow can scale automatically based on the incoming data volume, ensuring that you can handle the expected rate of 5000 messages per second."},{"timestamp":"1706242320.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nOption A\n\nPros:\n\nThis option is relatively simple to implement.\nIt can be used to compute the moving average over any time window.\nCons:\n\nThis option can be computationally expensive, especially if the data stream is large.\nIt can be difficult to troubleshoot if the alert does not fire when it is supposed to.","poster":"vamgcp","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"963242"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"893837","content":"Selected Answer: A\nthe correct answer is between A and B since it doesn't make sense to use Pub/Sub combined with Kafka.

This is a fundamental capability of Kafka.\n\nSupport for Publish/Subscribe Semantics: Kafka supports publish/subscribe semantics through topics. You can have hundreds of topics in Kafka, and consumers can subscribe to these topics to receive messages in a publish/subscribe fashion.\n\nRetain Per-Key Ordering: Kafka retains the order of messages within a partition. If you have a key associated with your messages, you can ensure per-key ordering by sending messages with the same key to the same partition.\n\nScalability: Kafka is designed to handle high-throughput data streaming and is capable of scaling to meet your needs.\n\nApache Kafka aligns well with the requirements you've outlined for centralized data ingestion and delivery.
