Deploy Google Cloud Datalab to a virtual machine (VM) on Google Compute Engine.\n\nGoogle Cloud Datalab is a powerful interactive tool for data exploration, analysis, and machine learning. By deploying it to a VM on Google Compute Engine, you can provide her with a robust and scalable environment where she can work with large datasets, create labeled datasets, and perform data analyses efficiently.\n\nOption A (running a local version of Jupyter on her laptop) might not be sufficient for very large datasets, and her laptop's limited power could still be a bottleneck.\n\nOption B (granting access to Google Cloud Shell) is useful for running command-line tools but may not provide the interactive and visual capabilities she needs.\n\nOption C (hosting a visualization tool on a VM on Google Compute Engine) is beneficial for visualization tasks but does not cover the full spectrum of data analysis and machine learning tasks that Google Cloud Datalab offers.","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1050525"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD - as it is a FULL set up, not a shell that is needed...","comment_id":"999556","poster":"gudguy1a","timestamp":"1709652720.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"994675","timestamp":"1709182440.0","poster":"sergiomujica","upvote_count":"2","content":"Nowadays it should be similar to D, deploy a Vertex workbench"},{"content":"As per Options , Correct Answer should be D. ie Datalab\nHowever Datalab is no longer used in GCP (Deprecated in Sep2022), It is Vertex AI or Deep Learning VM Images","timestamp":"1708245900.0","comment_id":"984230","poster":"yash12","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"HeoMaTo","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI think.\nAnswer is D","comment_id":"984170","timestamp":"1708237140.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"Acocado","content":"Datalab is deprecated.
