BigQuery leverages precomputed results from materialized views and whenever possible reads only delta changes from the base tables to compute up-to-date results. Materialized views can be queried directly or can be used by the BigQuery optimizer to process queries to the base tables.\n\nQueries that use materialized views are generally faster and consume fewer resources than queries that retrieve the same data only from the base tables.
