Build materialized views on top of the sales table to aggregate data at the day and month level.\n\nMaterialized views are precomputed views that cache the results of a query, which can significantly improve query performance and reduce costs by avoiding repeated computation. They automatically update with changes to the base table, ensuring data freshness without additional maintenance.\n\nhttps://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-intro"},{"comment_id":"1332432","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is the answer.\nMaterialized Views:\n\nMaterialized views in BigQuery are precomputed views that store the results of a query, allowing for much faster query execution because BigQuery doesn’t need to recompute the results each time the query is run. The results are stored in a persistent table, which significantly improves performance for repeated queries that aggregate the same data.\nIn this case, you can create materialized views that aggregate the sales data at the day and month levels. This will reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed for each query and speed up the response time.\nMaterialized views also lower costs because BigQuery only scans the precomputed data in the materialized view, rather than the full 50 TB sales history table.","poster":"hussain.sain","timestamp":"1735307820.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"question_id":242,"answer":"C","question_text":"You are administering a BigQuery on-demand environment.
