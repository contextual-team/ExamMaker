The company has patents for innovative optical communications hardware. Based on these patents, they can create many reliable, high-speed backbone links with inexpensive hardware.\n\nCompany Background -\nFounded by experienced telecom executives, MJTelco uses technologies originally developed to overcome communications challenges in space. Fundamental to their operation, they need to create a distributed data infrastructure that drives real-time analysis and incorporates machine learning to continuously optimize their topologies. Because their hardware is inexpensive, they plan to overdeploy the network allowing them to account for the impact of dynamic regional politics on location availability and cost.\nTheir management and operations teams are situated all around the globe creating many-to-many relationship between data consumers and provides in their system. After careful consideration, they decided public cloud is the perfect environment to support their needs.\n\nSolution Concept -\nMJTelco is running a successful proof-of-concept (PoC) project in its labs. They have two primary needs:\n✑ Scale and harden their PoC to support significantly more data flows generated when they ramp to more than 50,000 installations.\n✑ Refine their machine-learning cycles to verify and improve the dynamic models they use to control topology definition.\nMJTelco will also use three separate operating environments `\" development/test, staging, and production `\" to meet the needs of running experiments, deploying new features, and serving production customers.\n\nBusiness Requirements -\n✑ Scale up their production environment with minimal cost, instantiating resources when and where needed in an unpredictable, distributed telecom user community.\n✑ Ensure security of their proprietary data to protect their leading-edge machine learning and analysis.\n✑ Provide reliable and timely access to data for analysis from distributed research workers\n✑ Maintain isolated environments that support rapid iteration of their machine-learning models without affecting their customers.\n\nTechnical Requirements -\nEnsure secure and efficient transport and storage of telemetry data\nRapidly scale instances to support between 10,000 and 100,000 data providers with multiple flows each.\nAllow analysis and presentation against data tables tracking up to 2 years of data storing approximately 100m records/day\nSupport rapid iteration of monitoring infrastructure focused on awareness of data pipeline problems both in telemetry flows and in production learning cycles.\n\nCEO Statement -\nOur business model relies on our patents, analytics and dynamic machine learning. Our inexpensive hardware is organized to be highly reliable, which gives us cost advantages. We need to quickly stabilize our large distributed data pipelines to meet our reliability and capacity commitments.\n\nCTO Statement -\nOur public cloud services must operate as advertised. We need resources that scale and keep our data secure. We also need environments in which our data scientists can carefully study and quickly adapt our models. Because we rely on automation to process our data, we also need our development and test environments to work as we iterate.\n\nCFO Statement -\nThe project is too large for us to maintain the hardware and software required for the data and analysis. Also, we cannot afford to staff an operations team to monitor so many data feeds, so we will rely on automation and infrastructure. Google Cloud's machine learning will allow our quantitative researchers to work on our high-value problems instead of problems with our data pipelines.\nGiven the record streams MJTelco is interested in ingesting per day, they are concerned about the cost of Google BigQuery increasing. MJTelco asks you to provide a design solution. They require a single large data table called tracking_table. Additionally, they want to minimize the cost of daily queries while performing fine-grained analysis of each day's events. They also want to use streaming ingestion.

They help businesses throughout the world manage their resources and transport them to their final destination. The company has grown rapidly, expanding their offerings to include rail, truck, aircraft, and oceanic shipping.\n\nCompany Background -\nThe company started as a regional trucking company, and then expanded into other logistics market. Because they have not updated their infrastructure, managing and tracking orders and shipments has become a bottleneck. To improve operations, Flowlogistic developed proprietary technology for tracking shipments in real time at the parcel level. However, they are unable to deploy it because their technology stack, based on Apache Kafka, cannot support the processing volume. In addition, Flowlogistic wants to further analyze their orders and shipments to determine how best to deploy their resources.\n\nSolution Concept -\nFlowlogistic wants to implement two concepts using the cloud:\n✑ Use their proprietary technology in a real-time inventory-tracking system that indicates the location of their loads\n✑ Perform analytics on all their orders and shipment logs, which contain both structured and unstructured data, to determine how best to deploy resources, which markets to expand info. They also want to use predictive analytics to learn earlier when a shipment will be delayed.\n\nExisting Technical Environment -\nFlowlogistic architecture resides in a single data center:\n✑ Databases\n- 8 physical servers in 2 clusters\n- SQL Server `\" user data, inventory, static data\n- 3 physical servers\n- Cassandra `\" metadata, tracking messages\n10 Kafka servers `\" tracking message aggregation and batch insert\n✑ Application servers `\" customer front end, middleware for order/customs\n- 60 virtual machines across 20 physical servers\n- Tomcat `\" Java services\n- Nginx `\" static content\n- Batch servers\n✑ Storage appliances\n- iSCSI for virtual machine (VM) hosts\n- Fibre Channel storage area network (FC SAN) `\" SQL server storage\nNetwork-attached storage (NAS) image storage, logs, backups\n✑ 10 Apache Hadoop /Spark servers\n- Core Data Lake\n- Data analysis workloads\n✑ 20 miscellaneous servers\n- Jenkins, monitoring, bastion hosts,\n\nBusiness Requirements -\n✑ Build a reliable and reproducible environment with scaled panty of production.\n✑ Aggregate data in a centralized Data Lake for analysis\n✑ Use historical data to perform predictive analytics on future shipments\n✑ Accurately track every shipment worldwide using proprietary technology\n✑ Improve business agility and speed of innovation through rapid provisioning of new resources\n✑ Analyze and optimize architecture for performance in the cloud\n✑ Migrate fully to the cloud if all other requirements are met\n\nTechnical Requirements -\n✑ Handle both streaming and batch data\n✑ Migrate existing Hadoop workloads\n✑ Ensure architecture is scalable and elastic to meet the changing demands of the company.\n✑ Use managed services whenever possible\n✑ Encrypt data flight and at rest\nConnect a VPN between the production data center and cloud environment\n\nSEO Statement -\nWe have grown so quickly that our inability to upgrade our infrastructure is really hampering further growth and efficiency. We are efficient at moving shipments around the world, but we are inefficient at moving data around.\nWe need to organize our information so we can more easily understand where our customers are and what they are shipping.\n\nCTO Statement -\nIT has never been a priority for us, so as our data has grown, we have not invested enough in our technology. I have a good staff to manage IT, but they are so busy managing our infrastructure that I cannot get them to do the things that really matter, such as organizing our data, building the analytics, and figuring out how to implement the CFO' s tracking technology.\n\nCFO Statement -\nPart of our competitive advantage is that we penalize ourselves for late shipments and deliveries. Knowing where out shipments are at all times has a direct correlation to our bottom line and profitability. Additionally, I don't want to commit capital to building out a server environment.\nFlowlogistic's management has determined that the current Apache Kafka servers cannot handle the data volume for their real-time inventory tracking system.\nYou need to build a new system on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that will feed the proprietary tracking software.

For example, with gsutil you can copy many files in parallel with a single command, copy large files efficiently, calculate checksums on your data, and measure performance from your local computer to Cloud Storage.","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1598062320.0","poster":"atnafu2020"},{"timestamp":"1597942260.0","poster":"haroldbenites","content":"C is correct","comments":[{"timestamp":"1597942380.0","comment_id":"162370","upvote_count":"3","poster":"haroldbenites","content":"It Says: \"...that they are identical.\" , You must not use sample."}],"upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"162369"},{"upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"126866","content":"C is correct.","poster":"Rajuuu","timestamp":"1593955200.0"},{"timestamp":"1593054240.0","poster":"dambilwa","upvote_count":"4","content":"Option [C] is most appropriate","comment_id":"119053"},{"timestamp":"1584896760.0","comment_id":"67026","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"6","content":"Should be C"}],"isMC":true,"question_id":303,"exam_id":10,"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1584430260,"answers_community":["C (88%)","13%"]},{"id":"IZJHXLXdbgDjcVB5SOoA","unix_timestamp":1663777020,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer":"C","exam_id":10,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/view/83115-exam-professional-data-engineer-topic-1-question-85/","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"C","choices":{"A":"Convert your batch BQ queries into interactive BQ queries.","D":"Increase the amount of concurrent slots per project at the Quotas page at the Cloud Console.","C":"Switch to flat-rate pricing and establish a hierarchical priority model for your projects.","B":"Create an additional project to overcome the 2K on-demand per-project quota."},"answer_images":[],"question_id":304,"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"sedado77","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI got this question on sept 2022.
