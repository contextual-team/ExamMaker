This can make it more prone to human error and also could require more manual work to keep track of the different versions and their correspondance with the codebase.\n\nOn the other hand, option C, Use Cloud Build to include the release version tag in the application image, allows you to automate the process of adding the release version tag to the application image during the build process. This can make it easier to track the different versions of your application and their association with the codebase. Additionally, Cloud Build allows you to automate different steps of the build and deployment process, such as building, testing and deploying the images, making it easier to manage and keep track of your deployments.","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"772093"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAns: C\n\nExam passed and taken on 19/12/2022, 50/50 from this dump without buying the full access and looking for 'devops' word here: https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/1/","poster":"floppino","comment_id":"755472","timestamp":"1671952860.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe correct answer is C","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"646700","poster":"GCP72","timestamp":"1660473180.0"},{"comment_id":"622111","timestamp":"1656155940.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"C should be right.\n\nhttps://cloud.google.com/build/docs/build-push-docker-image#build_an_image_using_a_build_config_file","poster":"[Removed]"},{"content":"C is a right option","comment_id":"616618","timestamp":"1655280840.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"nuthanj800"},{"content":"I go for B\nhttps://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/pushing-and-pulling","upvote_count":"2","poster":"meetplanet","timestamp":"1639680420.0","comment_id":"503126"},{"comment_id":"494452","poster":"alaahakim","upvote_count":"3","content":"Ans: C","timestamp":"1638717540.0"},{"timestamp":"1624577040.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"C. tag your images with the sourced code release version.","poster":"guruguru","comment_id":"389988"},{"upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"388377","timestamp":"1624405140.0","poster":"JuanitoNN","content":"https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/pushing-and-pulling"}],"comment_id":"388375","poster":"JuanitoNN","content":"I think is B, is the normal process in this cases","timestamp":"1624404660.0"}]},{"id":"37CugwbG2ghSQZqo7Co8","isMC":true,"answer":"C","choices":{"C":"Establish a communication channel where incident responders and leads can communicate with each other.","B":"Contact the affected service owners and update them on the status of the incident.","D":"Start a postmortem, add incident information, circulate the draft internally, and ask internal stakeholders for input.","A":"Look for ways to mitigate user impact and deploy the mitigations to production."},"answer_ET":"C","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","question_images":[],"question_text":"You are on-call for an infrastructure service that has a large number of dependent systems.

Purchase Committed Use Discounts.\n\nExplanation:\n\nWhen you know that you will have a workload running on a fixed set of instances for several months, you can take advantage of Committed Use Discounts to lower the costs. These discounts provide a lower, sustained usage rate for a committed period of time (e.g. 1 or 3 years) in exchange for committing to use a certain number of virtual machine (VM) instances or n1-standard hours. This is a good choice because you can lower costs without any performance implications and the workload is stable with the exact amount of resources allocated to it."},{"timestamp":"1671952920.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"floppino","comment_id":"755476","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAns: A\n\nExam passed and taken on 19/12/2022, 50/50 from this dump without buying the full access and looking for 'devops' word here: https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/1/"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer is A","poster":"GCP72","timestamp":"1658736960.0","comment_id":"636558","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"621983","poster":"[Removed]","comments":[{"content":"Agreed with your comment, A is right","timestamp":"1666579440.0","comment_id":"702634","poster":"AzureDP900","upvote_count":"1"}],"content":"\"business-critical workload ....... for several months\", preemptible is not suitable in here.\n\"The workload is stable with the exact amount of resources allocated to it\" , exclude B.\n\nA should be OK.","timestamp":"1656136920.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1650994980.0","poster":"ghadxx","content":"Selected Answer: A\nC.
