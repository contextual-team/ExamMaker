This will allow you to identify which dependent applications might be causing performance issues, so that you can focus on optimizing those services specifically.",

Then, you can configure BigQuery billing export to export the billing data to BigQuery. This will allow you to use SQL queries to break down the costs based on the labels and see how much each system costs. You can use the GCP Console or the gcloud command-line tool to assign labels to instances. Once you've done that, you can configure BigQuery billing export in the console, and create a Bigquery table to store the exported billing data.",

Blue/green deployments involve deploying the new version alongside the existing one, routing only a portion of the traffic to the new version initially. Once you verify that the new version is performing well and there are no issues, you can fully migrate traffic to the new version. This allows for a safe rollback if any issues arise."
