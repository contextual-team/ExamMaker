Use Stackdriver Profiler to visualize the resources utilization throughout the application\n\nThe most probable cause of the database timeout when the number of concurrent active users remained stable is a performance issue. Stackdriver Profiler can be used to identify and diagnose performance issues in the application. Profiler can help you to visualize the resources utilization throughout the application, including CPU and memory usage, and identify any parts of the application that might be causing high load. This can help you understand how the application is utilizing the resources and identify any bottlenecks in the code that might be causing the timeouts.\n\nOther possible solutions, while they can be useful in certain situations, are not as relevant in this scenario.\nOption A is not relevant as it is not related to the issue.\nOption C while it can be helpful in certain scenarios, in this case it's less likely to be the cause of the problem.\nOption D is a security tool that can detect vulnerabilities in the application, but it's not related to the database timeouts.","comment_id":"772082","poster":"JonathanSJ","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1673416080.0"},{"timestamp":"1673367300.0","comment_id":"771605","content":"I would go for C. \nC.

If the errors is from the application then it wouldn't be \"database timeout\", so rather than running Profiler in your application, go check whether there is an increased number of connections is more intuitive. 2. Other than that, the question mentions \"After an update to the application\" which imply that there could be a bug regarding to SQL so that's why if \"concurrent active users remained stable\", the database could still timeout because of bugs.
