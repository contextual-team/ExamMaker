This ensures that the build step for your CI pipeline can access APIs inside the private VPC without exposing API traffic to the public internet. Private pools minimize management overhead by providing a secure and controlled environment for running builds.\n\nOptions B, C, and D involve different configurations, but they may introduce unnecessary complexity, security risks, or exposure of API traffic to the public internet, which contradicts the security requirements provided.","poster":"xhilmi","timestamp":"1702037040.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1701534180.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"nqthien041292","comment_id":"1086307","content":"Selected Answer: A\nVote A"},{"comment_id":"1062417","poster":"mshafa","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe default pool has limits on how much you can customize the environment, particularly around private network access.
