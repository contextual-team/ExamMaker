This action ensures that traffic is directed to the previous deployment, mitigating any issues introduced by the new version. It is a controlled and Kubernetes-native way to perform rollbacks, allowing for seamless transitions between different versions of the application without downtime. Using the kubectl rollout undo command (option A) is another rollback method, but updating the Service provides a cleaner and more declarative approach within the Kubernetes environment.",

By configuring a logging sink to send logs to a bucket and setting the retention period on the bucket to 365 days, you leverage Google Cloud's managed logging and storage services.\n\nThis approach abstracts the log storage from your applications running in Cloud Run and Cloud Functions, ensuring that logs are retained for the specified duration without requiring modifications to individual codebases. Additionally, providing your client access to the designated bucket allows them to retrieve the logs seamlessly. It's a centralized and efficient solution that aligns with best practices for log management in oogle Cloud.",

The Standard Tier offers lower-cost network services compared to the Premium Tier, which can result in lower network costs. However, the Standard Tier may not offer the same level of functionality and features as the Premium Tier, which can limit your ability to optimize your network for your specific needs.\n\nIn contrast, using a Google Cloud HTTP Load Balancer as Ingress, as suggested in option D, can provide more fine-grained control over network traffic, which can help you optimize your network usage and reduce network costs. Additionally, a load balancer can distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend instances, which can help reduce the amount of network bandwidth used by each instance.",

By implementing a liveness probe, the Kubernetes system periodically checks the specified endpoint of the microservice to determine its health. If the microservice becomes unresponsive or encounters the 403 errors, Kubernetes will automatically restart the Pod.\n\nThis approach ensures continuous operations by proactively detecting and addressing issues, minimizing manual intervention. It aligns with Google-recommended practices for handling service health and availability in a Kubernetes environment with minimal steps and complexity."
