This approach involves creating a Development and Production GKE cluster in separate GCP projects. In each cluster, a Kubernetes namespace is created per team. Then, Kubernetes Role-based access control (RBAC) is configured so that each team can only access its own namespace. This ensures that the teams are isolated from each other and can only access the resources they need, while minimizing costs by using the same clusters for different teams.",
