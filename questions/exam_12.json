With folders, you can use the tree command to see variants. For example, with branches, you can't tell if the delta between a prod and stage branch is an upcoming change in configuration or a permanent difference between what stage and prod should look like.\nhttps://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/concepts/gitops-best-practices#use-folders\n\n\n\"GKE Infrastructure (Anthos Config Management Kustomize manifests) repository is shared: different overlay directories are different environments\"\nhttps://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/tutorials/multiple-environments-config-sync#repository_architecture",

This makes it easy to maintain and update common IaC across env.\n\nGKE Infrastructure (Anthos Config Management Kustomize manifests) repositories are separated:\nEach env GKE configuration is kept in a separate repo, using different branches for different env. This separation ensures that the GKE configurations for different env are distinct and can be managed independently.\n\nApplication (app source code) repositories are separated:\nEach application has its own repo, and different branches can be used for different features or env.
