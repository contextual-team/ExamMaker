Because such applications write to different log files on disk, the best way to handle them in Kubernetes is to use the sidecar pattern for logging. \n\nIn this solution, you add a logging agent in a sidecar container to your application (in the same pod) and share an emptyDir volume between the two containers, as shown in this YAML example on GitHub. You then configure the application to write its logs to the shared volume and configure the logging agent to read and forward them where needed.",

Depending on your GKE cluster master version, either fluentd or fluentbit are used to collect logs. Starting from GKE 1.17, logs are collected using a fluentbit-based agent. GKE clusters using versions prior to GKE 1.17 use a fluentd-based agent.
