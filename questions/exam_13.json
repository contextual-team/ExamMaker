To resolve this issue following Google-recommended practices, you should choose option C: Add the Logs Writer role to the service account.\n\nBy adding the Logs Writer role to the service account, you grant the necessary permissions to write logs to Cloud Logging. This role provides the required access for the agents running on the instance to send log entries to Cloud Logging. Make sure to follow the principle of least privilege and only grant the minimum permissions required for your application to function.\n\nTherefore, the recommended solution is to add the Logs Writer role to the user-managed service account attached to the Compute Engine instance.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1090843"},{"timestamp":"1701513000.0","comment_id":"1086055","upvote_count":"2","poster":"nqthien041292","content":"Selected Answer: C\nVote C"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nSame reason as KHOUKHA.","comment_id":"1062439","timestamp":"1699137540.0","upvote_count":"4","poster":"mshafa"},{"content":"B is correct : https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/agent/logging/troubleshooting#verify_default_service_account_permission","poster":"Mar_Mar","timestamp":"1698248940.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1053846"},{"comment_id":"1049826","upvote_count":"3","poster":"activist","content":"I think answer C is correct in granting the existing service account the least privilege to write logs.","timestamp":"1697922240.0"}],"question_images":[],"answer":"C"},{"id":"rduZ3XkXwdfYdkmlQ3on","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"koo_kai","upvote_count":"5","content":"Selected Answer: C\ninsufficient memory","comment_id":"1056376","timestamp":"1698517140.0"},{"poster":"xhilmi","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nGiven the scenario where the heap usage of the application grows constantly until it restarts, the issue is likely related to memory consumption. Therefore, the appropriate action to take is to address the memory-related problem. In this context, option C is the recommended.\n\nBy increasing the memory limit in the application deployment configuration, you provide more memory resources to the application, potentially preventing it from exhausting its memory and triggering restarts.\n\nOptions A and B may not directly address the underlying memory problem. Option D, adding Cloud Trace, is more focused on request tracing and may not directly resolve the memory growth issue. Therefore, increasing the memory limit is the most relevant step to take based on the symptoms described.","timestamp":"1702021680.0","comment_id":"1090849"},{"poster":"nqthien041292","timestamp":"1701513060.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1086056","content":"Selected Answer: C\nVote C"},{"comment_id":"1068848","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThat's what I do at work :-)","poster":"pharao89","timestamp":"1699818840.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"timestamp":"2023-10-28 20:19:00","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_id":62,"question_text":"","answer_images":[],"exam_id":5,"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"A","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/view/124850-exam-professional-cloud-devops-engineer-topic-1-question-154/","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1698517140,"answer":"C","choices":{"A":"Increase the CPU limit in the application deployment.","D":"Add Cloud Trace to the application, and redeploy.","C":"Increase the memory limit in the application deployment.","B":"Add high memory compute nodes to the cluster."}},{"id":"clE4XEIS6eGR9rRhGT7f","answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"Create a storage bucket with the name specified in the Terraform configuration.","A":"Change the Terraform code to use local state.","D":"Grant the roles/storage.objectAdmin Identity and Access Management (1AM) role to the Cloud Build service account on the state file bucket.","C":"Grant the roles/owner Identity and Access Management (IAM) role to the Cloud Build service account on the project."},"answer":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/view/124266-exam-professional-cloud-devops-engineer-topic-1-question-155/","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1703815620.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nthis is regarding the permission, hence providing the correct role will resolve this","poster":"kish18","comment_id":"1108249"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nTo resolve that issue, you should ensure that the Cloud Build service account has the necessary permissions to access the Cloud Storage bucket used for storing Terraform state.\n\nThe recommended practice is to grant the roles/storage.objectAdmin Identity and Access Management (IAM) role to the Cloud Build service account on the state file bucket.
