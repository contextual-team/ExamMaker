Use the filter-record-transformer Fluentd filter plugin to remove the fields from the log entries in flight.\n\nFluentd is a log collector and processor that is commonly used with Google Cloud Platform. The filter-record-transformer plugin for Fluentd can be used to modify log entries as they are being collected, allowing you to remove sensitive fields from the log entries in real-time before they are written to Stackdriver.

The SLI for availability is defined as follows:\nThe proportion of valid requests served successfully. (good request / total request)\n\nThe SLI for latency (sometimes called speed) indicates whether the service is fast enough. \nThe proportion of valid requests served faster than a threshold.\nLatency is commonly measured as a distribution. Given a distribution, you can measure various percentiles. For example, you might measure the number of requests that are slower than the historical 99th percentile. In this case, we consider good events to be events that are faster than this threshold, which was set by examining the historical distribution. You can also set this threshold based on product requirements. You can even set multiple latency SLOs, for example typical latency versus tail latency.",
