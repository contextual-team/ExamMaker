Move to a peer-review based process for individual changes that is enforced at code check-in time and supported by automated tests: Implementing a peer-review process ensures that changes are reviewed by team members, which can catch issues early in the development process. Automated tests can provide additional confidence in the quality of changes. This approach encourages collaboration and reduces the need for a formal CAB.\n\nE. Ensure that the team's development platform enables developers to get fast feedback on the impact of their changes: Fast feedback mechanisms, such as automated testing and continuous integration pipelines, allow developers to quickly identify and address issues with their changes. This reduces the need for a formal approval board like CAB and promotes a culture of ownership and responsibility among developers."
