Cloud Build lets you build software quickly across all languages. Get complete control over defining custom workflows for building, testing, and deploying across multiple environments such as VMs, serverless, Kubernetes, or Firebase.\n\nWhat is Spinnaker? Multi-cloud continuous delivery platform for releasing software changes with high velocity and confidence. Created at Netflix, it has been battle-tested in production by hundreds of teams over millions of deployments. It combines a powerful and flexible pipeline management system with integrations to the major cloud providers.\n\nGoogle Cloud Build and Spinnaker belong to \"Continuous Deployment\" category of the tech stack."

Latency metrics, which measure the time it takes for requests to be processed, are appropriate for evaluating the specific performance requirements outlined in the scenario. By selecting a latency metric for a request-based method, such as P95 (percentile 95), you can precisely measure and evaluate the desired performance level—requests being addressed in fewer than 300 ms at least 90% of the time.\n\nThis approach aligns with the specific performance criteria and allows for a granular assessment of the service's responsiveness.",
