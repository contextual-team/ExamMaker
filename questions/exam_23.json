Enable VPC Flow Logs on the production VPC network frontend and backend subnets only with a sample volume scale of 1.0.\n\nVPC flow logs are a feature that allows you to capture network traffic data in your VPC network. To ensure that all network traffic is captured for analysis, you should enable VPC flow logs on the production VPC network frontend and backend subnets with a sample volume scale of 1.0. This will capture all network traffic data, including the potentially malicious process, for further analysis.\nOption A. Enable VPC Flow Logs on the production VPC network frontend and backend subnets only with a sample volume scale of 0.5 is not adequate, as it captures only half of the network traffic, there is a chance that the logs of the malicious process are not captured.\nOption C and D, Enable VPC Flow Logs on the testing and production VPC network frontend and backend subnets with a volume scale of 0.5/1.0. Apply changes in testing before production, is not necessary, it's important to have the logs in production environment to detect and mitigate the problem.","poster":"JonathanSJ","timestamp":"1673738700.0"},{"comment_id":"1086095","poster":"jomonkp","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nOption B","timestamp":"1701515280.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB: enabling VPC Flow Logs on the production VPC network frontend and backend subnets only with a sample volume scale of 1.0.
