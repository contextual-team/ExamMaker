This indicates that the potential increase in revenue due to the higher availability is $900. Given that the investment cost is $2,000, the gain falls short of covering the investment, making the decision not to pursue the availability increase financially impractical.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct choice, aligning with a thorough cost-benefit analysis and demonstrating that the increase in availability is not worth the $2,000 investment for a single year of usage.","comment_id":"1088958"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1698938280.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nSorry the answer should be A.\n99,99%-99,9%=0.09%\n0.09% of 1.000.000 is 900 dollar","comment_id":"1060643","poster":"khoukha"},{"content":"99,99%-99,9%=0.09% \n0.09% of 1.000.000 is 900 dollar, answer is B","timestamp":"1698938160.0","comment_id":"1060641","upvote_count":"1","poster":"khoukha"},{"comment_id":"1022240","poster":"ManishKS","upvote_count":"2","content":"Answer Should be A","timestamp":"1696163400.0"}],"exam_id":5,"choices":{"C":"Calculate the value of improved availability to be $1,000, and determine that the increase in availability is worth the investment.","A":"Calculate the value of improved availability to be $900, and determine that the increase in availability is not worth the investment.","D":"Calculate the value of improved availability to be $9,000, and determine that the increase in availability is worth the investment.","B":"Calculate the value of improved availability to be $1,000, and determine that the increase in availability is not worth the investment."},"question_text":"","topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-10-01 14:30:00","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/view/122029-exam-professional-cloud-devops-engineer-topic-1-question-103/"},{"id":"ec8x6ULWLQ6YnKQ3SfmV","answer_ET":"B","answer_description":"","question_text":"A third-party application needs to have a service account key to work properly.
