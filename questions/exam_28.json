This way you can incrementally test and monitor the new feature, before it is deployed to all the pods. This approach is useful when you want to minimize the risk of introducing new bugs or breaking changes in your production environment, it allows you to have more control over the process, and it's less likely to cause service disruption, or to have all the pods down at the same time.",

As the proportion of report generation requests that result in a successful response is a valid availability Service Level Indicator (SLI) for the report generation feature. This indicator measures the percentage of requests for report generation that are successfully completed, and it is an indicator of the service availability. This SLI provides a clear and measurable way to track the availability of the report generation feature. It is a simple and easy to understand metric, that it can be easily monitored and reported. It can be used to track the performance of the report generation feature over time and detect any potential issues that may cause it to become unavailable. It also allows you to detect and diagnose issues in the system quickly and take appropriate action to mitigate them. Additionally, it aligns well with the customer's expectation of the report generation feature as they want to see a high percentage of successful report generation requests, which indicates that the feature is working correctly.",

Distributed tracing allows you to trace the path of a request as it travels through multiple services and identify where delays may be occurring. This can provide detailed information about the request and response timings for each service, making it easier to pinpoint which services are causing delays in your application. OpenTelemetry and Stackdriver Trace are both available on GCP, and provide easy integration with Kubernetes and other GCP services.",
