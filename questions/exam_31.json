It can also help you to identify trends over time. However, it can be difficult to configure uptime checks for complex services, and it may not be possible to detect all types of errors.\nUsing select_slo_burn_rate is a more granular way to detect consumption of error budget. It can be used to monitor individual SLOs and to identify specific types of errors.
