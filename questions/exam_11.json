This approach allows the isolation of the new revision from live production traffic initially. \n\nOnce the deployment is complete, extensive testing can be conducted without affecting users. Subsequently, when confident in the new version's stability, production traffic can be gradually directed to it using the Cloud Run services update-traffic command.\n\nThis combination ensures a controlled and risk-mitigated approach to deploying and testing new versions, with the ability to roll back if any issues arise during the testing phase.",
