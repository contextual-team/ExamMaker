By changing the selector to include the version label, you effectively roll back the traffic to the working version, providing a quick and effective solution to address the user request failures observed after the update to app-green.\n\nThis enables developers to investigate and troubleshoot the issue in a controlled manner without affecting user experience, and it serves as an interim solution while further investigation and remediation are carried out.",

Subsequently, creating a logs-based metric allows you to define a metric based on the extracted information from the logs, specifically focusing on the number of requests from the suspicious IP address. This setup minimizes operational overhead by leveraging existing infrastructure and provides a streamlined way to monitor and analyze the targeted metric related to the suspicious activity, aiding in swift detection and response to potential security issues.",
