This approach follows the principle of least privilege by granting the specific role needed for read-only access to Data Access audit logs. The roles/logging.privateLogViewer role is more restrictive than roles/logging.viewer, providing access only to private logs, such as Data Access audit logs, and aligns with Google-recommended practices for securing sensitive data.\n\nBy assigning this role to a group with all security team members, you can efficiently manage and update permissions for the entire team, maintaining a centralized and organized approach to access control for the designated logs in the _Required bucket."
