Store the Terraform code in a version-control system. Establish procedures for pushing new versions and merging with the master.\n\nUsing a version-control system such as Git, allows you to store different versions of the code and track changes that are made to it. This allows you to easily roll back to a previous version if necessary, and ensures that all team members are working on the same version of the code. It also allows team members to collaborate on the code and merge changes with the master version. This is the most effective way to share code and maintain versioning, as it provides a centralized location for all code and allows for easy collaboration and management of code changes.","comments":[{"content":"My last message was wrong, this is the good one:\n\nA.
