The first step should be to roll back the experimental canary release. This will remove the new feature from production and revert the system to its previous state, which should reduce the number of errors and decrease latency.\n\nAfter rolling back the canary release, you can start monitoring latency, traffic, errors, and saturation (Option B) to determine the impact of the rollback and to make sure that the system is stable.\n\nYou can also record data for the postmortem document of the incident (Option C) to learn from the incident and to improve future releases.\n\nLastly, you can trace the origin of 500 errors and the root cause of increased latency (Option D) after rolling back the canary release to understand what went wrong and to prevent similar issues from happening again in the future.","comment_id":"774050"},{"timestamp":"1671952920.0","poster":"floppino","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"755478","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAns: A\n\nExam passed and taken on 19/12/2022, 50/50 from this dump without buying the full access and looking for 'devops' word here: https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/1/"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe first step that you do to reduce issue is to rollback, then comes the identifying and fixing the errors part","poster":"sri1016","timestamp":"1670735040.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"741420"},{"comment_id":"702630","content":"Rollback is the best option to avoid customer impact.

The home page of the application displays multiple widgets containing content such as the current weather, stock prices, and news headlines. The main serving thread makes a call to a dedicated microservice for each widget and then lays out the homepage for the user. The microservices occasionally fail; when that happens, the serving thread serves the homepage with some missing content. Users of the application are unhappy if this degraded mode occurs too frequently, but they would rather have some content served instead of no content at all. You want to set a Service Level Objective (SLO) to ensure that the user experience does not degrade too much.
