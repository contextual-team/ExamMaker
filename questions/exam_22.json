Configure the horizontal pod autoscaler to use the average response time from the Liveness and Readiness Probes.\n--> using health check as a trigger of scaling is weird. if the response time of the health check is delayed, it may be caused by resources issues such as CPU, memories, and so on. so you should use such values as SLIs.\n\nB.

Install the Stackdriver custom metrics adapter and configure a horizontal pod autoscaler to use the number of requests provided by the GCLB.\n\nTo scale the deployment of the application's frontend using an appropriate Service Level Indicator (SLI), we need to monitor the traffic coming to the application. One way to do this is to install the Stackdriver custom metrics adapter, which provides visibility into GCLB metrics such as request counts, bytes sent and received, and active connections. We can then configure a horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) to scale the number of pods based on the request count coming through the GCLB, which will help to ensure that our application is always available to handle the incoming traffic.",

Horizontal pod autoscaler will scale based on the custom metrics such as requests per second(i.e. no. of requests). but vertical autoscaling is also useful feature for the frontend application. as it requires more resource needs if the traffic is high. Since vertical autoscaling will first delete the pod and adjust the cpu and memory to recreate the pod, It can cause downtime for that duration and not recommended. Hence, More inclined towards answer C. Still, reply my answer with your explanation please\n\n https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/horizontalpodautoscaler#overview",
