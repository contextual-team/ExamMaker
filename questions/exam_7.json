This enables parallel execution of smaller tasks, speeding up the overall deployment.\n\n- Option E, automating promotion approvals, eliminates manual intervention and streamlines the progression from development to test environments, further reducing delays and potential errors associated with manual approval processes.\n\nBoth options contribute to a more efficient and automated deployment pipeline in Google Cloud Deploy.",

You expect a service user growth rate of 10% month-over-month over the next six months. Your service is fully containerized and runs on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), using a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Standard regional cluster on three zones with cluster autoscaler enabled. You currently consume about 30% of your total deployed CPU capacity, and you require resilience against the failure of a zone. You want to ensure that your users experience minimal negative impact as a result of this growth or as a result of zone failure, while avoiding unnecessary costs. How should you prepare to handle the predicted growth?",
