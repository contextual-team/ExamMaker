Instead, you route a copy of the live traffic to the new version (the \"shadow\" version) while the production version continues to serve real user traffic. This allows you to gather performance metrics and test the new version under real-world conditions without affecting the end users' experience.",

This process involves specifying how to extract relevant information from the text payload and organize it into a JSON structure.

Set up the Kubernetes Engine clusters with Binary Authorization.\n\nBinary Authorization is a feature of Google Kubernetes Engine that allows you to ensure that only containers that are verified to be from a trusted source are deployed to your clusters. It works by using a policy that checks the signatures of container images before they are deployed. You can configure Binary Authorization to require that all images are signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA) or that they are signed by a trusted key that you manage. This ensures that only images that have been successfully built by your trusted CI/CD pipeline are deployed to your production clusters.",
