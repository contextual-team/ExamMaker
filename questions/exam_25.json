This scaling factors in the automatic_scaling settings that are provided on a per-version basis in the configuration file. A service with basic scaling is configured by setting the maximum number of instances in the max_instances parameter of the basic_scaling setting. The number of live instances scales with the processing volume. You configure the number of instances of each version in that service's configuration file. The number of instances usually corresponds to the size of a dataset being held in memory or the desired throughput for offline work. You can adjust the number of instances of a manually-scaled version very quickly, without stopping instances that are currently running, using the Modules API set_num_instances function.\n\nhttps://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-instances-are-managed",

This will ensure that there are enough resources available to handle the spike in traffic, reducing the likelihood of latency for users. Additionally, you may also consider enabling high availability on the CloudSQL instances and upgrading the GCS buckets to Multi-Regional for more resiliency.",

After a short spike in website traffic, you notice a big increase in latency for all user requests, increase in CPU use, and the number of processes running the application. Initial troubleshooting reveals:\n✑ After the initial spike in traffic, load levels returned to normal but users still experience high latency.\n✑ Requests for content from the CloudSQL database and images from Cloud Storage show the same high latency.\n✑ No changes were made to the website around the time the latency increased.\n✑ There is no increase in the number of errors to the users.\nYou expect another spike in website traffic in the coming days and want to make sure users don't experience latency.
