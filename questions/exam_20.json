By assigning the Container Developer role to this service account, it will have the necessary permissions to deploy new images to GKE.

Run a Git compare between the previous and current Cloud Build Configuration files to find and fix the bug.\nThis option allow you to compare the previous and current Cloud Build Configuration files and find what has been changed and understand what could be causing the issue.
