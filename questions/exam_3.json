This diagnostic tool helps pinpoint where the connectivity breaks down, enabling you to analyze the network configuration and resolve any misconfigurations or obstacles that might be hindering communication between the clusters. This approach provides a focused and efficient way to troubleshoot the specific network layer where the connectivity issue occurs without requiring execute access to workloads and nodes in the clusters.","comment_id":"1089077","timestamp":"1701850380.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nNetwork Connectivity Center is not the greatest tool but in this case we don't really have any options with the restrictions in the question so B","poster":"Andrei_Z","timestamp":"1700559900.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1076164","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1104152","content":"Is it not easier the ans D, both VPC seems to be in the same GCP project ?
